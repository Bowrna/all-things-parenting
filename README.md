# all-things-parenting

this is my project that i am creating after my experience as mother. Being mother is one of the toughest roles that I have taken so far. While other roles in jobs and academic side has some manual guide that could support me, parenting is a different ball of game. There is no one way for fixing a problem. what works for one kid may not work for another. So i came up with an idea of building an app that brings best of worlds from Reddit and Stackoverflow tool for a parent. For more updates, Stay tuned!
